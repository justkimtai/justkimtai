# 👋 Hi, I'm Justus Kimtai

**Machine Learning/AI Engineer | Full-Stack Developer (Web & Android) | Linux Lover**  
📍 Based in Machakos, Kenya

## 🚀 About Me
I'm a deeply curious, passionate and disciplined techie with a deep love for intelligent system and user-centered web & Android experiences. My journey into Machine Learning has been a beautiful one and very practical, founded on my deep love for math and science. Academically, I have a strong engineering background in manufacturing and industrial engineering from Moi University, Kenya.

I build things that work and make a difference.

## 🧠 ML/AI Projects

These projects reflect my growing skills in Machine Learning, many inspired by DigitalOcean tutorials and shaped by real-world curiosity:

- 🔬 [`breast_cancer_classifier`](https://github.com/Justus-Kimutai/breast_cancer_classifier) – A model trained to classify malignant and benign breast tumors.
- ✍️ [`handwritten-digit-ai`](https://github.com/Justus-Kimutai/handwritten-digit-ai) – MNIST-powered digit recognition neural network.
- 🏘️ [`california-housing-price-predictor`](https://github.com/Justus-Kimutai/california-housing-price-predictor) – Predicts housing prices based on California census data.

I’m currently developing a **recommendation system** for [Cedro Adventures](https://www.cedroadventures.com), where I work full-time as a Software Developer, to help travelers discover destinations they’ll love.
